    <h1>BirdLore.org</h1>

    <p>Help digitize historical bird records.</p>

    <h3>The process</h3>

    <p>Once this is set up the process will be:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Identify a historical record source</li>
    <li>Verify it is not already documented on eBird</li>
    <li>Transcribe to a digital format</li>
    <li>Import to eBird</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Criteria</h3>

    <p>Initially, all records should be either a published account of bird species observations, or a hand-written account by a known source.</p>

    <p>Any textual data submitted should be accompanied by an original photocopy for verification.</p>

    <h3>Roadmap</h3>

    <p>This site obviously isn't ready yet to facilitate any of this. Some things that need to get done:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Create a login/user/registration system</li>
    <li>Create a means of submitting a source (photo upload)</li>
    <li>Create a way to browse sources</li>
    <li>Add tools to transcribe sources to a format eBird can recognize (this is partly complete)</li>
    <li>Add peer review process before submission to eBird</li>
    <li>Allow for open data downloads of all data submitted here</li>
    </ul>
